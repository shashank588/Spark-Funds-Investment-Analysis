<hr>

## Project Brief
The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.
<br>
## Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:<br>
- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
- For this analysis, considering a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
